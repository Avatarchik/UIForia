// Todo 
- Support style skinning
- Support handlers for list events (add, remove, move)
- Support <Slot> elements
- Filter Lists
- Support arbitrary creation of child nodes?
- Smart attributes (tooltip, route, etc)
- formal props (required, optional, pattern matching)
- invoke on property changed handlers after OnCreate to initialize them
- template attrs (for tooltips, etc)
- animation system should play animations for any float, int, or color values, not just style properties
- grid needs to respect padding, margin, and alignments
- grid needs to respect min-max()
- grid might respect fit-content, fill-content
- investigate anchoring more deeply
- make sure transform offsets work

<Template id="content">
    
</Template>

<thing x-tooltip="{template: 'content', delay: 1f, direction: ToolTipDirection.Top, text: 'text'}/>
